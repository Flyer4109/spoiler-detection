"Just rewatched Battle of the Bastards for probably the 10th time and it never gets old. Hands down one of the best episodes of #GameOfThrones ever made. Also, Jon Snow has never looked hotter than when he’s caked in mud manically beating seven shades of shit out of Ramsay."
So I have 2 episodes left of #GameOfThrones &amp; idk how to feel about that 🙃
My brother just finished watching the first series of #GameOfThrones his top 3 characters drastically changed from the beginning to the end. Just you wait bro!!
My dad is watching #GameOfThrones by himself in a separate room. I just over heard him singing along to the theme song.
