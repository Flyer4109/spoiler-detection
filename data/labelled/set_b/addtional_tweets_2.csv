Arya's got to stop with this bullshit accusing Sansa of helping the Lannisters kill Eddard
"""I hate this Sansa/Arya storyline, Littlefinger is so obviously playing them both and turning them against each other"""
Arya is so dumb to be influenced by Littlefinger planting that letter and turning her on Sansa
Arya and Sansa should be supporting each other now they are reunited not threatening each other
Jon and the rest of them on their quest beyond the wall have the air of being on a very cold and reluctant stag do
"""Things never end well whenever Jon is beyond the wall, this time it's zombie bears"""
a zombie polar bear because why not #wightpolarbear 
Now we know why they had to budget to put Ghost in this season. #undeadpolarbear #zombiebear
Can't believe Dany and Cersei are actually going to meet
Daenerys and Cersei meeting eachother!!
Cersei is going to hate Daenerys when they meet
Jon and the lads headed beyond the wall #thehound #tormund #gendry
The undead bear is going to kill someone
Death by zombie bear #gameofthrones
"""Sandor's shitting himself, great big zombie bear on fire, nightmare"""
The effects of the wight bear are quite good tbf
the Night king has polar bears now too
Littlefinger was so gross I'm glad he's dead
Petyr Baelish's death was so gratifying 
Good riddance #littlefinger
rip littlefinger
lord baelish is dead
littlefinger's death scene was great
so happy Sansa and Arys ganged up on Littlefinger
Thoros got killed by the bear 😢
rip Thorors of Myr
So sad Thoros is dead
"""""""I just got bit by a dead bear""""- Thoros of Myr"""
So if a white walker is killed all the wights they created die too
great way to kill wights just kill the white walker that made them
"""if a white walker dies, all the wights they created are destroyed"""
how exactly do they reckon they're going to bring that wight back home with them
the wight was calling the whole army
Jon is surrounded by wights beyond the wall #gotseason7
At least we know wights can't swim
Jon and the gang surrounded by wights on the frozen lake
so Daenerys got that raven from gendry overnight?? How fast was it flying 
"""They wont all survive the night on the frozen lake, hurry up Daenerys """
Daenerys will never get beyond the wall to save them in time
Daenerys is going beyond the wall!
Dragons beyond the wall
so weird seeing Daenerys in winter clothing to go beyond the wall
How will the dragon get beyond the wall fast enough
Thoros froze into an icicle
they've got to burn thoros' body
"""""""unless the lord of light is going to send us a bit of fire"""" as if tormund knew the dragons were coming!"""
So in theory if they kill the night king ALL of the other white walkers/wights will die? Convenient
Breinne and Jamie are going to be reunited! #gotseason7
Daenerys riding north!
the poor dragons are going to freeze beyond the wall
Daenerys just happened to have a lovely winter coat to go north in
the night king has good aim with the ice javelin
drogon was basically a sitting duck but the night king had to aim for one of the flying dragons?
nobody knew viserion's name until he died
first dragon dead
now daenerys just has two dragons 😢
the night king gained a dragon!
rip viserion
the dragons look so cool in the snow
dany is here with the kids to fuck the night king's shit up
second time someone attempted to kill one of the dragons was successful!
turns out viserion didn’t have plot armour like drogon
why did my favourite dragon have to die
if the dragons died in the same order as their namesakes it should have been Rhaegal first
jon and the lads vs army of wights
omg Tormund so nearly died fighting the wights! #gotseason7
That wight bit a whole chunk out of Tormund
thought Tormund was going to die then! #armyofwights
Daenerys swooping in to save Jon beyond the wall!
don't worry Jon the your dragon gf is coming
Drogon is here to save the day as per! #dragonsbeyondthewall
Daenerys looks so good in her beyond the wall getup
Dany lost one of her children 😭
the night king killed viserion!
white walkers have ice javelins that kill the dragons!
it's as is the night king knew drogon was dany's favourite so killed the other one instead
Dany doesn’t even look that sad when Viserion was killed
Jon looked more upset about dead Viserion than Dany
Can'e believe first a dead dragon and then Jon nearly died too
Dany looked sadder about leaving Jon behind than Viserion
the other dragons screaming when Viserion died was so sad
Now jon's going to take on the entire army of the dead by himself? Gotseason7 #episode6
Benjen is back in season 7!
Benjen saves jon's life
rip uncle Benjen
Benjen appears out of thin air to save another stark
sad uncle Benjen is dead!!
So glad Benjen stark saved Jon
at least they managed to get the wight back past the wall
that poor wight is probably going mad inside that box
Drogon and Rhaegal are mourning for their brother
The other dragons are so sad about Viserion's death
I wonder if we weill see Drogon vs undead Viserion
Sansa's found Arya's secret stash of faces #awks
Sansa finding Arya's faces is so grim looool
"""""""What are these?"""" """"My faces"""" poor Sansa doesn’t know what the fuck Arya is on about"""
Arys threatening to kill Sansa and take her face is the dumbest and most out of character thing
Arya is coming at Sansa with a knife!
Arya is threatening to kill Sansa and take her face??
Sansa's just now realising that Arya lost her marbles in Braavos
Dany huddling by Jon's sickbed is quite cute actually
Jon is so whipped he even bent the knee for Dany
Jon finally bent the knee to Daenerys
It's so cute when Jon finally calls Dany 'my queen'!
Jon bending the knee to Daenerys is basically a declaration of love
how did they pull the entire dead dragon out of the lake??
where did the wights get the chains from to get viserion out of the lake?
oh no he's brining the dragon back to life
Viserion has blue eyes!
now the night king has a dragon!
Blue eyed Viserion!
As if Westeros didn’t already have enough problems now the night king has a dragon
So sad that viserion is going to be evil now!
Should have known viserion would come to an unfortunate end the same as his namesake 
Daenerys finally won the 'bend the knee' debate 
"""""""""""chaos is a ladder""""- littlefinger"""" - bran stark"""""""
"""bran repeating littlefinger's """"chaos is a ladder"""" back to him, the three eyed raven sees everything"""
bran's goodbye to meera is so underwhelming 😭
glad Meera is gone she was so annoying
goodbye Meera Reed
Arya finally returns to Winterfell!
so happy there are now three Starks in Winterfell
Can't believe Arya is now back in Winterfell
cant wait for Arya to be reunited with Sansa and Bran now she's in Winterfell
Arya meeting the three eyed raven!
Weird seeing Arya back home in Winterfell
More stark siblings reunited!!!
So gutted Jon wasn't there when Arya came back to Winterfell
Arya gets to Winterfell and the first place she goes is the Crypts
Sansa and Arya are reunited in the Crypts #gotseason7
Arya finally got to see Ned's statue in the Crypts of Winterfell
Arya calling Sansa 'Lady Stark' is so weird
I wanted Arya and Sansa to be happier to see each other
"""Arya- """"My list of people I'm going to kill"""" Sansa- """"jesus christ"""""""
Why are Sansa and Arya having like a 'who has had the most traumatic time since we were last here' competition
"""Bran telling Arya """"I see quite a lot of things"""" is such a funny understatement #gotseason7"""
Bran wasn't happy to see Arya at all when they finally met again
Arya was so dissapointed that Bran is just a creep now he's the three eyed raven
Brienne finally got both Stark sisters safe and reunited
Jon showing Dany the white walker cave drawings!
There are ancient cave drawings of the Others! #gameofthrones
Did Jon do those little cave drawings of the white walkers himself lol
Westerosi cave drawings of white walkers!
People were documenting the white walkers in Dragonstone! #cavedrawings
Maybe Daenerys will believe the white walkers are real now that she's seen the cave drawings
"""Jon's cave drawing plan didn’t work, Dany still wants him to bend the knee"""
Finally get to see Brienne vs Arya!
Who will win in a swordfight Brienne or Arya??
Brienne finally met her match in a swordfight with Arya!
Arya and Brienne fighting in Winterfell
Watching Arya and Brienne fight is so funny the size difference in their swords are ridiculous
Arya meeting Littlefinger again in Winterfell
Jon and Theon meeting again after all this time!!
Poor Theon must be terrified to meet Jon again after what he did
Jon isn't very friendly to Theon when they meet again on Dragonstone! #poortheon
Theon deserves worse that what Jon said to him when they met again
Finally get to see the Dothraki in battle!
First battle with the Dothraki fighting for Dany
Jamie looked terrified to see the Dothraki coming towards him and I don’t blame him
The Dothraki coming for Jamie's fleet!
Dany's first battle!#gotseasonseven
The spoils of war finally shows Dany in battle with Drogon and the Dothraki
Dothraki and dragons in battle! #thespoilsofwar
Must be terrfiying to see a great big dragon coming over the hill towards you! Poor Jamie!
Jamie finally sees Daenerys
Jamie and Bronn seeing a dragon for the first time omg!!
Bronn and Jamie's faces when they saw Drogon loooool
Jamie's entire fleet got melted by dragonfire
Dothraki vs the Lannisters
The battle in the spoils of war is absolutely brutal! #dothrakifighters
Drogon burning Jamie's whole fleet is so satisfying!
Cersei's dragon killing arrow proves to be absolutely useless
did Cersei actually think that dumb thing was going to be able to kill a dragon lmao it failed
Can't believe bronn of all people nearly killed a dragon!
Bronn putting Cersei's dragon killing weapon to the test#thespoilsofwar
How all those arrows missed Dany in battle is beyond me
Daenerys came close to death in the battle with Jamie's fleet omg
Drogon is fucking Jamie's shit up
Giant dragon killing arrow is put to the test
Dragon killing arrow works on Dothraki man but not dragon
Tyrion seeing Jamie on the battlefield in the spoils of war 😭
Bronn got so close to killing a dragon!
Imagine if Bronn had succeeded in killing Drogon
Drogon gets hot with the huge arrow!
Bronn fired Cersei's massive arrow at Drogon!! D:
Bronn was so nearly burned alive by Drogon
First time seeing Dragons in action n Westeros! #Danyvsjamie
Jamie attempts to Kill Dany!!
"""""""You fucking idiot""""' Tyrion as Jamie charges as Daenerys"""
Tyrion did nothing to try and help Dany when Jamie was charging at her
Drogon nearly kills Jamie Lannister 😢
cliffhanger as Jamie sinks to the bottom of  a lake!
Omg I really hope Jamie isn't dead when he falls into that lake!
I guess drowning would be better than being burnt alive?? #Jamielannister
episode ends on a cliffhanger as Jamie is pushed into a lake and sinks to the bottom
Who was it that saved Jamie's life when Drogon was breathing fore at him??
Jamie looked so funny sinking to the bottom of that lake
Can't wait until next week to see if Jamie survived!!
Is Jamie dead or not?? #thespoilsofwar
What if that's Jamie's death though?? #gotseason7
Can't believe they would leave us on such a cliffhaNGER!!! #isjamiedead #gotseason7
The spoils of war was such an action packed episode! Dragons burning people for the first time in Westeros ☺️
Dany is fucking the lannister's shit up with her dothraki army! Jamie is shook!
That's why they say never face the Dothraki in an open field… #thespoilsofwar
There's so much violence in this show 😫Dany vs Jamie battle was so gory
My heart stopped when that arrow hit Drogon!
So the huge crossbow can hurt the dragons but not kill them I guess
Drogon burnt the massive crossbow so Cersei will have to get another one made
Phew so glad the massive arrow didn’t kill Drogon!
Tyrion calling Jamie a 'fucking idiot' as he ran towards a dragon was so funny
Jamie is alive after the battle with Daenerys!
Bronn saved Jamie from Drogon!
Bron pulls Jamie out of the river alive after the battle with the Dothraki ☺️
Dickon and Randyll Tarly refuse to bend the knee to Daenerys!
the Tarlys refuse to Join Dany😭
Rip Dickon Tarly
rip Randyll Tarly
Drogon burns the Tarlys alive!!
Daenerys sentences the Tarlys to death
First execution by dragon!
Now Sam is the last of his house 😢 rip his father and brother
"""""""Dickon Tarly, Randyll Tarly, I Daenerys of the house Targaryen sentence you to die. Dracarys."""" -Daenerys season 7"""
Drogon is finally used to execute those who won't bend the knee!
At least now everyone knows Dany means buisness!! #riptarlyfamily
Tyrion tries to talk Dany out of burning Dickon and Randyll Tarly alive
Jon's first real encounter with a dragon goes brilliantly! ☺️
Dany looked so surprised that Drogon liked Jon so much lol
Drogon liked Jon more than he likes Dany
Jon strokes Drogon for the first time! So exciting!
Jorah returns to Daenerys on Dragonstone!!
Jorah reveals to Dany that he is cured from Greyscale omg I'm so emotional
Dany looked so happy to see Jorah back and cured from greyscale ☺️
So happy to see Jorah and Khaleesi reunited on dragonstone!
Daenerys and Jorah are reunited the second time! #gotseason7
"""Dany must be so releived now that she knows Jorah is cured, she probably missed having him as an advisor"""
Omgg so glad Jorah is back with Dany now she's in Westeros ☺️
Jon finally finds out Arya and Bran are alive yaaay!!
Jon looked so emotionless when he found out Arya and Bran were still alive
I wanted Jon to be happier to find out Arya was still alive 😢
Why didn't Jon seem happier to find out Arya was alive and back in Winterfell?? #starksiblings
Dany looked so gutted when Jon said he was going beyond the wall again
Poor Dany her men are all leaving her again #questbeyondthewall
So they're going to try and bring a wight back from beyond the wall??
Gendry is back!!! #gotseasonseven
Omg I'm so happy we get to see Gendry again 😂
So Gendry was in fleabottom all along!! He wasn't rowing lol
"""""""Thought you might still be rowing""""- Davos to Gendry"""
Can't believe Gendry was just in kings landing this whole time hahaha
So happy to see Gendry yay ☺️😊☺️
Now Gendry is back in the show I want him and Arya to be reunited 
"""""""This is Gendry""""- Davos """"He'll do"""" - Tyrion"""
Cersei is going to be so pissed off that Jamie met with Tyrion lmaooo
Watch out Jamie! Cersei is going to go mad that you went behind her back and met Tyrion! #gotseason7
As if Cersei knew Tyrion and Jamie met and didn't try to stop it! Not like her at all!
Ohhh no Jamie is not happy Cersei is pregnant lol
So Jamie and Cersei are just coming all out to everyone with the whole incest thing now she's pregnant again XD
Jamie: who will you say is the father? Cersei: you Jamie: oh right yeah
The twins aren't even bothering to pretend anyone else fathered Cersei's fourth baby lol
Jamie took the news of Cersei's pregnancy better than I thought actually #incestbaby #gotseason7
"""I can't believe Jamie is gonna go along with Cersei's plan to just tell everyone he is the father of her new baby, what an idiot"""
Davos: now nobody needs to know who you really are so just keep it quiet Gendry: hello Jon my name is Gendry I'm robbert baratheon's bastard how are you
Gendry and Jon meeting is everything!!
"""Yay so happy Gendry and Jon are working together, the dream team 😂"""
Jon's face when Gendry said he was shorter than he expected hahahaha
Gendry: You're not as tall as I expected Jon: I take the precaution on a good coat and a short friend
Can't believe Gendry is draggin Jon saying he's short omg
Jon doesn't like to be called short apparently xD Gendry put his foot in it
"""I knew Jon and Gendry would get along, my favourite characters"""
Jon and Gendry together are like second generation Robert and Ned 😊
Tyrion and Jorah reunited on Dragonstone! I love them
So happy Dany now has Jorah and Tyrion serving her again!! #gotseasonseven
"""""""You'd think we'd be better at farewells""""' Dany to Jorah season seven 😢"
Dany and Jorah's emotional farewell interrupted by Jon lol
Dany looked more gutted to see Jon got beyond the wall than Jorah lol #sorryjorah
So happy Sam is finally leaving the Citadel! His storyline was so boring there
Yes finally the end of Sam just doing fuck all in the Citadel
Sam takes Gilly and runs away from the Citadel!!
Sam's like fusk this lol I'm gonna steal all your books and be on my way #thecitadel
Sam leaving the Citadel feels a little bit sad 😢
Littlefinger reckons he's being so stealthy sneaking around Winterfell but Arya knows he's up to something
Was Littlefinger messing with Arya when he left that letter for her to find??
No Arya you've been fooled by Littlefinger! He planted that letter!
What's Baelish plotting leaving letters around for Arya to find hmm
Never thought Arya would be so foolish as to be bamoozled by Littlefinger…
Tormund does not like Jorah lol
Tormund was so dissapointed Jon didn't bring 'the big woman' hahaha
Never thought I would see the Hound beyond the wall 😮
Feel sorry for all the guys going north who've never been beyond the wall… they're in for a shock #gendry #thehound #jorah
Daenerys fan club are headed north of the wall! #jon #tyrion
what does that letter Littlefinger hid that Arya found say?? Couldn't read it
I know the letter Arya found was written by Sansa but what did it say?
"""Petyr Baelish is up to his old tricks again, this time he's messing with Arya"""
Why didn't tyrion go beyond the wall with Jon and the others?? #eastwatch
So sad as soon as Dany and Jorah were reunited he left her again 😢
Am I the only one that ships Jon and Gendry together… they just seem to get on so well!
"""Gendry volunteering to help Jon beyond the wall, what a cutie"""
Now Gendry is with Jon maybe they'll be reunited with Arya together!
Cersei wasn’t as mad as I thought she would be that Ollena killed Joffrey
Is it just me or was Cersei not even that angry that Ollena admitted to killing Joffrey??
I can't deal with Jon going back beyond the wall and leaving Daenerys 😢 I waited 6 seasons for you to meet! Stay together!!
Am I the only one that feels like #jonerys was a bit rushed? I mean they only met this season and they were fucking by the end of it lol
Aw yeah we're gonna get to see the Dothraki and Unsullied fighting together!
Tyrion returning to King's Landing from dragonstone!
So weird seeing all Dany's crew heading back into King's landing together 
Shit's gonna go down!! Dany and Cersei meeting 😂
Is it bad that I'm so excited to see Daenerys and Cersei meet just for the drama hahaha
"""Cersei's seeing all her least favourite people, Tyrion, Daenerys and Jon snow"""
Yaaaaay Tyrion and Pod reunited ☺️
"""So glad to see Pod and Tyrion meet again in King's landing, they had such an underrated friendship"""
The Hound when Brienne told him Arya was alive!! Omg so cute
Sandor's little smile when Brienne said the onlt person who would need protecting was whoever got in Arya's way omg he's such a proud dad
So glad Sandor knows Arya is safe and well in Winterfell! He loves her and Sansa
Bronn and Tyrion are so great together hahaha so glad we got to see them reunited this season #gotseason7
"""Wooow the dragon pit looks so impressive, always cool to see a new set with so many main characters in it """
"""Tyrion, Cersei, Jon, the Hound, Brienne, Missandei and the Mountain all in one scene omg shit's gonna go down!!"""
Brienne and Jamie seeing eachother again omgg I love them together
Cersei's sly little look at Brienne lol like back off my man
Cersei's probably pissed that Brienne is there she knows Jamie is this close to leaving her for her hahah
omg the tension as sandor and gregor meet again!!
"""""""You know who's coming for you, you've always known""""' sandor clegane to gregor clegane"""
Sandor threatening gregot yaaaaay we could get cleganebowl in season 8 yet!!
"""I want sandor to kill the mountain so bad- """"You know who's coming for you""""- The Hound"""
Yaaas look at Daenerys making her entrance in king's landing on drogon! Gooo
Drogon looks fucking huge in that area jesus
Cersei better be shitting herself Drogon is a fucking monster
that look between Cersei and Dany they hate eachother looooool
I love how the first thing Cersei says to Daenerys is being salty about her lateness
Drogon makes his debut in king's landing! He looks ferocious as hell
Dany brings two Dragons with her to kings landing as she meets with Cersei
Wooooah drogon looks so impressive swooping into the pit! Bet Cersei's shitting it
Now she's seen one for real Cersei's wishing she had a dragon too
dany flying into the pit in king's landing on drogon is honestly iconic
It's taken us seven seasons but dragons have finally made it to king's landing!
I can't believe Cersei is so calm after seeing that huge beast lmao
Daenerys should get drogon to burn euron lol he's so annoying do everyone a favour
come on!! Don't waste screentime on Euron just talking shit in the finale we want to hear from Cersei and Dany!!
Jon and Dany look like such a power couple in king's landing
Is it just me or does drogon actually look twice the size in this episode?? Maybe king's landing is just really small lol
Feel sorry for all the poor guys who've never seen a dragon before they must have shit themselves #cersei #themountain
I was yelling at my screen when sandor threatened his brother in the finale like yess drag him
"""""""We've been here for quite some time""""- Cersei """"my apologies- Dany"""
Jamie and Tyrion still have such a bond it's obvious from how Jamie defends him from Euron
"""""""we are a group of people who dislike one another"""" yeah nice undertsatement Tyrion #cersei #daenerys #jon snow"""
Why is Cersei so stubborn omggg should have known she wouldn’t believe Jon about the night king
So cersei doesn’t believe a word of what Jon says about the army of the dead to no one's surprise
Did anyone really think Cersei would agree to this truce what were they all thinking??
Cersei's having none of Daenerys' bullshit!!
Bring on the wight! Cersei is shook
How can the queen still not agree when she's seen a wight for herself! 😮
Cersei's face when the wight went for her hahahah
Everyone looks so unsettled by the wight in the box
Jon demonstrating to an audience how to kill the wights will never not be funny
Jon looked like cabin crew when he was explainig how to kill the wight hahah
"""""""I don't know what just happened, but I don't really care, I'm about to get the fuck up outta here, fuck this shit I'm out""""- Euron Greyjoy"""

"""Euron being like """"fuck this"""" and taking his fleet back the the iron islands it the best storyline he's had so far"""
Euron would be me if I saw that wight hahah no thanks I'm gone
Smartest decision Euron has ever made #nahfuckthat #thenightkingcantgetmeintheironislands
Daenerys looks so disgusted by Euron greyjoy like same girl
What's this?? Cersei is just agreeing to help fight the army of the dead?
So Cersei is actually gonna send her armies north? What?
Can't believe Cersei is being so reasonable about fighting the army of the dead
She's gonna back out or this must be a trick. No way Cersei would oull back her armies and be so reasonable
"""Breinne is just like """"the fuuuuuuck"""" when Cersei was being reasonable hahah #cerseivsnightking"""
"""Jon, I love you but please prioritise the realm over pledging yourself to Daenerys """
omg Jon refusing to un pledge himself to dany!! Bf goals
Dany looked so touched when Jon said he had already given his word to her and refused to pledge to Cersei
omg Jon's now got someone else insisting he bends the knee hahah poor guy
"""Can't believe Jon didn’t take Cersei's deal just to keep his word, he's such a fool!"""
Jon's heart is in the right place but his honour is gonna get everyone killed #bendthekneetocersei
Jon blew it for everyone by not agreeing to Cersei's terms 😢
Nooooo Jon now everything was for nothing!! #ripviserion
Now the dragon died for nothing bc Jon wouldn't go back on his word arrrhhgg
Jon think before you say things! Now you've blown it with Cersei 
"""""""I wish you hadn't done that"""" yeah so does everyone else Davos lol Jon's gone and fucked it up for everyone"""
Did anyone know Viserion's name before he died
Even Dany is like 'my dragon died' he had a name goddamnit!
Daenerys is lowkey so mad at Jon for fucking things up with Cersei
Dany looks impressed but pissed off that Jon blew things with Cersei by saying he was already pledged to her hahaha
Oh god Jon and Dany are gonna have an argument!! Jon made Viserion's death pointless
Tyrion suggesting Jon should have lied to Cersei lol do you know who you're talking to
Yeah ofc Jon should have just pretended to bend the knee to Cersei but this is Jon snow!! He doesn't play that way
Jon: lies wont help us in this fight. No but Cersei's army would have Jon you fool!
"""Jon saying 'lies won't help us in this fight' nah but neither will not having Cersei's army on your side, imbecile!!"""
Cersei HATES tyrion there's no way he can talk her into giving her army
is tyrion really going to dig Jon out of this shit with Cersei?? Don't think so
Noooo Tyrion don't talk to Cersei alone she'll definitely kill you!! Daenerys is right
"""Tyrion walking into the lion's den to talk to Cersei alone, let's hope he can convince her of the night king"""
Cersei accusing Tyrion of killing tommen and myrcella like yeah he's the one who blew up the sept of baelor right
Can't believe Cersei is trying to say Tommen's death was Tommen's fault when she'd the one who murdered his wife
"""""""poor little man, your papa was mean to you"""" is such a funny simplification of tyrion's stoyline haha nice one Cersei"""
Cersei didn't take the chance to kill tyrion what??
okay this is dumb book Cersei would take the oppurtunity to kill Tyrion in a heartbeat
Cersei hates tyrion and they're really acting like she couldn't bring herself to have him killed?
The most unrealistic thing about this episode is Cersei not being able to kill Tyrion
I don't get it why didn't Cersei kill Tyrion?? 
Can't believe Tyrion took the risk of telling Cersei to kill him like son she's crazy hahah
Is Cersei mellowing out? Surely in season 1 she would have taken the oppurtunity to kill Tyrion
"""Why does Cersei actually look shocked when Tyrion's like """"You're pregnant"""" like she was making it so obvious"""
So we're pretending that Cersei loves/cares about this baby too right? Talking all that shit to tyrion about protecting her family yeah right
Tyrion finding out Cersei is pregant omg!!
I'm surprised Tyrion took so long to figure out his sister was pregnant 
Oh no now Tyrion knows Cersei is pregnant what if he decided he wants to protect her??
Noooo Cersei's gonna manipulate tyrion with news of her pregnancy somehow
"""Cerseri's being so obvious about her pregnancy tpo tryion for a reason, I bet she's gonna use it to manipulate him"""
"""""""you're not like everyone else""""- jon to dany aw he's so whipped"""
So jon's out here suggesting Dany might actually be able to have children afterall?? I'm shook?
Wait so the witch who killed drogo could have been lying about dany not being able to have kids??
"""nvm about seven books of character building storyline regarding Daenerys not being able to have children, Jon's just like 'maybe that witch was lying lol'"""
The fact that Dany can't have children is such an important character arc for her!! And they're really about to throw all that away? I hope not
Ohhh no I can just tell they're going to make out that Daenerys actually could have children this whole time just so she has a baby with Jon. Now he's like the witch could have been lying
That's so dumb if the witch was actually lying and Dany could have kids this whole time
jon: maybe that witch was lying about you not being able to have children Dany: holy shit
Are Jon and Dany about to kiss?? They're stood verrrry close together in the dragon arena
I'm sorry but how tf did Tyrion actually change Cersei's mind about helping Dany
Cersei's gonna send her armies north?? How did tryion convince her to do that
Jon forgiving Theon awww
Theon looked so touched when Jon said he forgave him aw #givetheonahug2k18
I'm so happy Jon said he forgives Theon that gives me so much closure lol
Omg is Sansa actually gonna confront Arya for conspiring to kill her?? What is wrong with these two
Arya and Sansa need to work together and realise littlefinger is playing them ffs
"""""""You stand accused of murder, you stand accused of treason, how do you answer these charges… lord baelish?"""" OOOOOOOOHHHHH"""
When Sansa turned to Littlefinger and accused him of Murder and treason omggg I screamed at my tv
Littlefinger was actually the white guy blinking meme when Sasna accused him of murder and treason omg hahaha
Yaaaaas this is such a plot twist!! Sansa and Arya ganging up on littlefinger as it should be!!
OMG so happy Arya and Sasna ganged up on littlefinger I was worried for a second there haha
Can't believe for a whole 2 minutes there I actially thought Sansa was accusing Aryra of murder and treason
Arya's shit eating grin when Littlefinger realises he's the one on trial hahahah same girl
YAAAAAY Littlefinger is finally gonna get what he deserves 😂
"""So glad Sasna realised Littlefinger was a snake, knew she couldn't be that dumb"""
Sansa and Arya prove themselves true starks destroying an enemy of their family! #riplittlefinger
"""You stand accused of murder, you stand accused of treason, how do you answer these charges… lord baelish? MOST ICONIC PLOT TWIST"""
"""You stand accused of murder, you stand accused of treason, how do you answer these charges… lord baelish? #finishhim"""
"""""""My sister asked you a question"""" OMG ARYA WHY YOU GOTTA BE SO SAVAGE LITTLEFINGER IS SHOOK"""
I can't get over how shook littlefinger looks that he's about to die looool
"""Littlefinger: no of you were there to see what happened!! Bran, the three eyed raven: you held a knife to his throat Littlefinger: fuck"""
Bran snitching on Littlefinger with his visions iconic
Omg I've got a little tear I'm so proud of the stark kids destroying Little finger yaaaas
Petyr Baelish you just got fucking obliterated by three teenagers how do you feel
Littlefinger actually thinking he was playing the stark sisters lol bitch yoU THOUGHT
This is so satisfying!! Petyr is so fucking shook that Sansa is turning on him
Yeeesss been waiting for Sansa to turn on Baelish forever!!
Bran reciting Petyr Baelishes bullshit to him and then Sansa doing the same yaaaas
"""""""Sometimes when I want to know a person's motive I play a little game."""" -Sansa Stark"""
Littlefinger's face when Sansa was like 'sometimes when I want to know a person's motive I play a little game' he knew it was over
Littlefinger is finally going to pay for his crimes!!
Glad littlefinger is gonna die in a minute he was getting right on my last nerves
Littlefinger begging for his life is so pitiful
Littlefinger saying that he loves Sasna eweewwwww
Why does littlefinger think him telling Sansa he loves her is gonna change her mind?? Okay you're creepy and gross as well as a manipulative prick thanks
"""""""I've loved you""""-Littlefinger """"And yet you betrayed me""""- Sansa"""
Nooooo way can't believe Baelish is actually dead!!
Arya ticked somebody else off her list #riplittlefinger
Can't pretend I didn’t thoroughly enjoy seeing Littlefinger die tbh
We finally get an iconic littlefinger death scene!!
Am I the only one who's a bit sad littefinger is dead? Yeah? Okay
"""Jamie finally leaves Cersei good, he deserves so much better"""
"""Jamie and Cersei essentially break up, now he just needs to get with Brienne"""
Cersei has nobody now Jamie has left her too
Good Cersei deserves to be alone she should have known Jamie would leave her sometime
So now Jamie's left king's landing where is he gonna go?? North?
It's even snowing in King's landing omg winter is here
You know winter has descened now it's even snowing in King's landing
Snow as far south in king's landing! Winter Is Here 'gotseason7
Sam and Bran being reunited is making me emotional
wait so Jon isnt a bastard he's legit?? That means the iron throne is his!!
Dany is not going to be happy when it finally gets out that Jon has a better claim to the throne than her
Wait so if Jon isnt a bastard he's more entitled to the iron throne than Daenerys!
So we finally get to see Rhaegar and he just looks like Viserys in a worse wig
Rhaeger and Lyanna's wedding ceremony is sooo cute omg
So now Sam knows about R+L=J too!!!
Omggg Jonerys is happening!! This is not a drill!
So Jon snow isnt really a bastard my entire life has been a lie
Is it just me or is it a bit creepy that they're talking about how Jon and Dany are actually related while they're having sex
Can't believe Jon's real name is Aegon ewww
Noooo we don't need another Aegon! Jaeherys would have been a much better name for Jon
Jon is actually the heir to the iron throne whaaaaat
Dany is gonna be pissed when she finds out Jon is actually heir to the iron throne
Jon and Dany finally have sex in this episode!!
Why is Tyrion just lurking in the corridor while Jon and Dany have sex??
Tyrion is just forever alone in the corridor listening to Jon and Daenerys having sex
Is Tyrion listening to Jon and Dany have sex or what?? Why is he just standing there? #weird
Jon and Dany are such an attractive couple they're gonna make beautiful babies ☺️
watch dany get pregnant from the boat sex
who would have thought I would be so thrilled to see a guy fuck his aunt on a boat
Boatsex is happneing! #jonerys
Jon and Dany are fucking omg I can't believe it's actually happenning I've wanted this forver
Jon and Dany are having boatsex and everything is alright with the world
You guys are all so nasty enjoying Jon and Dany have sex they're related get a grip
I just can't help feel uncomfortable watching Jon and Daenerys have sex knowing they're related
The ice dragon in action!!
So Viserys breathes blue fire?? Or ice?
Omg the blue fire looks sooo cool #icedragon
Omg the army of the dead have finally reached the wall
seeing that fucking ice dragon come over the horizon gave me chills
I really hope viserion comes back to the good side 😢
The night king is finally at the wall!!
The undead dragon looks fucking awesome though
Viserion's fire is burning down the wall omg no!!!
The night king is riding that dragon like a pro
